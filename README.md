# Code for the Single Photon

This repo includes the code to simulate a tweezed particle controlled by an optimal control policy. Here we are going to:

* Implement Kalman Filter class to estimate certain states of the system needed for control
* Create an Environment class, where a tweezed particle will be simulated


## Installation

Well, now, how can you run this code?

1. First clone this repo in your computer. This can be done
    * Via SSH:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/QuantumAdventures/single-photons.git
    ```

    * Via HTTPS:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:QuantumAdventures/single-photons.git
    ```

    * Or, by downloading the .zip of the repo and unziping in your computer.

2. Install the requirements, this will set the libraries needed with the correct version in your computer. Inside the main folder of the project run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Inside the repo run the following command: 

    ```bash
    python setup.py install
    ```

## Usage

Now, with everything set, the notebooks can be executed. To create a new script or notebook importing some of the classes, just insert the following imports

```python
from single_photon.enviroment import Particle
from single_photon.estimator import KalmanFilter
```
